# TODO: Fix GitHub Pages Deployment

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Added base path "/film-library/" to vite.config.ts for GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment
- [x] Created 404.html in build directory to handle client-side routing for SPAs on GitHub Pages
- [x] Rebuilt the project with updated base path
- [x] Verified build output includes correct base paths in assets
- [x] Committed and pushed changes to GitHub
- [x] Added GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment

## Next Steps

- [ ] Go to GitHub repository settings â†’ Pages section
- [ ] Set Source: "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] The workflow will automatically deploy on each push to main
- [ ] Wait for the Actions workflow to complete (check Actions tab)
- [ ] Test the live deployment at https://zrncrblln.github.io/film-library/
- [ ] If still blank, check browser console for errors and verify assets are loading correctly

## Notes

- The app uses client-side routing without React Router, so 404.html redirects all routes back to index.html
- Base path ensures assets load correctly from the subdirectory
- Build output now includes "/film-library/" prefix in asset URLs
